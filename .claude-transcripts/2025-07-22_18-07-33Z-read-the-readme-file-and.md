> read the README file and generate a checklist of tasks to implement the system as a markdown file. Let  me review this checklist. Create a separate checkist for each part: Data Capture and Graph Web App.   Do not generate any code until I've reviewed the tasks and give you my go ahead.                        

I'll read the README file and create separate checklists for the Data Capture and Graph Web App components.

Based on the README, I'll create separate checklists for implementing the system. Let me create a markdown file with both checklists.

‚úçÔ∏è **Write: /Users/michael/Projects/oss/graph-monitor/implementation-checklists.md**
([view file](contents/implementation-checklists-71dba783.md))

I've created comprehensive checklists for both the Data Capture component and the Graph Web App component. The checklists break down the implementation into manageable tasks covering:

**Data Capture (Node.js):**
- Configuration management
- SQLite database setup
- Command execution and scheduling
- Data storage and rollup calculations
- Process management

**Graph Web App (React + Vite):**
- Project setup with recharts
- Configuration handling
- Database integration
- Chart rendering and data visualization
- User interface and real-time updates

Please review the `implementation-checklists.md` file and let me know if you'd like any modifications before I proceed with implementation.
