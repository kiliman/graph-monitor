The issue was that the server needed to be restarted after the database was populated with data, or there was some other timing issue that has now been resolved.\n\n## Summary\n\nI tested the API endpoint `http://localhost:3001/api/metrics/latest?key=all&name=status&limit=100` and found:\n\n1. **Initial Issue**: The API was returning an empty array `[]`\n2. **Investigation**: \n   - The SQLite database exists at `/Users/michael/Projects/oss/graph-monitor/metrics.db`\n   - It contains 261 records with three metric types: `duration`, `execution_time`, and `status`\n   - The status metric has data for two keys: `bde` and `google`\n3. **Resolution**: After adding debug logging and restarting the server, the API now correctly returns data\n\nThe API response for status metrics with `key=all` now includes data from both keys (`bde` and `google`), with each record containing:\n- `timestamp`: Unix timestamp\n- `key`: The source key (either \"bde\" or \"google\") \n- `value`: HTTP status code (200)\n- `unit`: null (no unit specified for status codes)\n\nThe server is working correctly and returning the expected data for the status chart visualization."
