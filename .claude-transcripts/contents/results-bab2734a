The only occurrence of `createLogger()` is in the logger.ts file itself where it's exporting the instance.\n\n## Summary\n\nI've successfully updated all files that import and use the logger to use it as an instance rather than calling it as a function. Here's what I changed:\n\n### Changes made:\n\n1. **`/Users/michael/Projects/oss/graph-monitor/data-capture/index.ts`**:\n   - Changed the import from `import createLogger from './logger.ts';` to `import logger from './logger.ts';`\n   - Changed the assignment from `this.logger = createLogger();` to `this.logger = logger;`\n\n### Files that didn't need changes:\n\n- **`logger.ts`**: Already exports an instance with `export default createLogger();`\n- **`executor.ts`**: Receives logger as a constructor parameter, doesn't import it directly\n- **`scheduler.ts`**: Receives logger as a constructor parameter, doesn't import it directly  \n- **`rollup.ts`**: Receives logger as a constructor parameter, doesn't import it directly\n- **`chartGenerator.ts`**: Receives logger as a constructor parameter, doesn't import it directly\n\nThe logger is now being used correctly as an instance throughout the codebase. The only file that directly imports the logger is `index.ts`, and it now uses it properly as an instance instead of calling it as a function."
