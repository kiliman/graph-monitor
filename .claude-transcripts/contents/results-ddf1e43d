      "text": "Great! The package.json already has `\"type\": \"module\"` set, which is necessary for ESM modules. The project is also configured to use Node's experimental TypeScript support.\n\n## Summary\n\nI have successfully converted all JavaScript files in the data-capture directory to TypeScript with ESM syntax. Here's what was done for each file:\n\n### Converted Files:\n\n1. **logger.ts** (`/Users/michael/Projects/oss/graph-monitor/data-capture/logger.ts`)\n   - Converted `require` to ESM `import`\n   - Added `node:` prefix for built-in modules\n   - Added TypeScript return type for `createLogger` function\n   - Used `export default` instead of `module.exports`\n   - Added `__dirname` workaround for ESM\n\n2. **config.ts** (`/Users/michael/Projects/oss/graph-monitor/data-capture/config.ts`)\n   - Added proper TypeScript interfaces for configuration types\n   - Converted to ESM imports with `node:` prefix\n   - Added type annotations for all methods and properties\n   - Used `export default` for the class\n\n3. **database.ts** (`/Users/michael/Projects/oss/graph-monitor/data-capture/database.ts`)\n   - Added interfaces for database return types\n   - Added proper TypeScript types for all methods\n   - Converted to ESM imports\n   - Added type safety for database operations\n\n4. **executor.ts** (`/Users/michael/Projects/oss/graph-monitor/data-capture/executor.ts`)\n   - Added interfaces for metrics and execution results\n   - Added type annotations for Winston logger\n   - Converted to ESM imports with `node:` prefix\n   - Properly typed all method parameters and returns\n\n5. **rollup.ts** (`/Users/michael/Projects/oss/graph-monitor/data-capture/rollup.ts`)\n   - Added interfaces for rollup intervals and data structures\n   - Added proper TypeScript types for all methods\n   - Converted to ESM imports\n   - Used type imports for dependencies\n\n6. **scheduler.ts** (`/Users/michael/Projects/oss/graph-monitor/data-capture/scheduler.ts`)\n   - Added interfaces for metrics and stored metrics\n   - Added proper TypeScript types for all class properties\n   - Converted to ESM imports with `.js` extensions\n   - Added type safety for configuration handling\n\n7. **chartGenerator.ts** (`/Users/michael/Projects/oss/graph-monitor/data-capture/chartGenerator.ts`)\n   - Added comprehensive interfaces for chart configuration and data\n   - Added proper TypeScript types for Chart.js integration\n   - Converted to ESM imports\n   - Added type safety for all chart generation methods\n\n8. **index.ts** (`/Users/michael/Projects/oss/graph-monitor/data-capture/index.ts`)\n   - Added type annotations for all class properties\n   - Converted to ESM imports with `.js` extensions\n   - Used `node:` prefix for built-in modules\n   - Added proper error handling types\n\n### Key Changes Made:\n- All `require()` statements converted to `import` statements\n- All `module.exports` converted to `export default`\n- Added `node:` prefix for all built-in Node.js modules\n- Added `.js` extensions to local imports (required for ESM)\n- Added TypeScript interfaces and type annotations throughout\n- Added `__dirname` and `__filename` workarounds for ESM modules where needed\n- Maintained all original functionality while adding type safety\n\nThe project is now fully converted to TypeScript with ESM syntax and should work with Node.js's experimental TypeScript support as configured in the package.json."
